This script is a Python-based utility for interacting with the VirusTotal API to scan files, check for existing scan reports, and analyze the results. Here's an overview of what the script does:

Key Features:

File Selection via GUI: Uses Tkinter to open a file dialog for selecting files to be scanned.

VirusTotal API Integration:
Uploads files to VirusTotal using an API key.
Fetches existing reports based on file hash (SHA-256).
Retrieves reports of uploaded files.
Analyzes results for malicious detections.

Concurrency: Uses threading with a semaphore to control the number of concurrent requests, which is helpful to avoid hitting API rate limits.

Result Analysis: Checks the scan results for any malicious findings and saves the results to a .txt file.
IP and Request Information: Checks remaining API requests left for the user's IP.
Colored Console Output: Uses the Colorama library to display colored messages for better readability.

Main Functionalities:
File Scanning (scan_type = 1): Selects files using a GUI, checks for existing reports by hashing the files, uploads files to VirusTotal if no existing report is found, and fetches the reports.
Results File Analysis (scan_type = 2): Analyzes pre-existing results files to identify any suspicious findings based on scan results.
API Request Information (scan_type = 3): Fetches the remaining API requests left using the VirusTotal API.

Execution:
The script is executed from the command line, allowing the user to choose the type of scan using command-line arguments. For example:

-t 1 for scanning files,
-t 2 for scanning results files,
-t 3 for checking the number of API calls left.
This script provides automated interaction with the VirusTotal API to check files for malware, analyze results, and manage file uploads efficiently.
